What we actually detect is UTF-\/8 support, as that\textquotesingle{}s what Node itself supports. If you have a UTF-\/16 locale then you won\textquotesingle{}t be detected as unicode capable.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md1803}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Windows}{Windows}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md1803}
Since at least Windows 7, {\ttfamily cmd} and {\ttfamily powershell} have been unicode capable, but unfortunately even then it\textquotesingle{}s not guaranteed. In many localizations it still uses legacy code pages and there\textquotesingle{}s no facility short of running programs or linking C++ that will let us detect this. As such, we report any Windows installation as NOT unicode capable, and recommend that you encourage your users to override this via config.\hypertarget{README.md_autotoc_md1804}{}\doxysubsubsection{\texorpdfstring{Unix Like Operating Systems}{Unix Like Operating Systems}}\label{README.md_autotoc_md1804}
We look at the environment variables {\ttfamily LC\+\_\+\+ALL}, {\ttfamily LC\+\_\+\+CTYPE}, and {\ttfamily LANG} in that order. For {\ttfamily LC\+\_\+\+ALL} and {\ttfamily LANG}, it looks for {\ttfamily .UTF-\/8} in the value. For {\ttfamily LC\+\_\+\+CTYPE} it looks to see if the value is {\ttfamily UTF-\/8}. This is sufficient for most POSIX systems. While locale data can be put in {\ttfamily /etc/locale.conf} as well, AFAIK it\textquotesingle{}s always copied into the environment.
